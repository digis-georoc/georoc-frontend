GEOROC compiles data from published, peer-reviewed literature.
GEOROC database curation and IT development is the focus of the DIGIS project (https://digis.geo.uni-goettingen.de)
funded by the German Science Foundation at the Göttingen Geoscience Center (GZG) (https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/125309.html) 
of the Georg August University of Göttingen. GEOROC data are provided free of charge and we ask that you use our data products for scientific and educational purposes only.
When intending to use GEOROC data products for commercial purposes we request that users contact GEOROC/DIGIS staff at
digis-info@uni-goettingen.de for conditions and permission.

- You are free to copy, remix, transform and redistribute the data in any medium and format.
- However, in doing so, you must give appropriate credit to GEOROC as well as to the original data sources. This includes proper referencing in a publication’s list of cited references (see below).
- If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must  distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.


Data provided through the GEOROC Data Repository are covered by separate licensing requirements as stipulated by the provider of the dataset(s).


Please follow these guidelines for how to cite GEOROC data.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Data Download from Database Query
------------------------------------

To cite the GEOROC database, please reference its URL in text and in figure captions: https://georoc.eu/.
Please cite the specific download by giving the date and, if possible, parameters of the query.
A summary of the query criteria may be viewed on the download page.

Example for manuscript text and figures:
------------------------------------

"Data were downloaded from the GEOROC database (https://georoc.eu/) on 1 March 2022, using the following parameters: geological setting = Continental Flood Basalt: Etendeka Province and rock name = basalt."

You should also cite the original references that contribute to the downloaded dataset.
These references are included in every GEOROC download.
For large datasets, we strongly encourage creating a secondary bibliography which is accepted as a supplementary
material file by many journals. This type of citation helps ensure that appropriate credit
is given to the scientists who originally generated the data.
