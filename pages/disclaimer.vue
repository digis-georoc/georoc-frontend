    <p class="mb-6">
      All data held within the GEOROC database have been harvested from peer-reviewed publications, comprising decades of international geochemical literature.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      The database is regularly supplemented with current publications. We take great effort to compile high-quality published data and to report all additional information on samples, analytical methods, reference materials and analytical uncertainties.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Note that only the information recorded in the respective publications can be entered into the GEOROC database. In specific cases geographic coordinates may have been extracted from sample location maps as provided by the authors. Wherever needed, mineral and rock names that did not comply with rock and mineral names from BGS and, respectively, IMA vocabularies, were modified to meet these nomenclature standards. However, the original names given by authors in a publication are maintained in the dataset comment.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      We cannot take responsibility for missing (meta-) data or analytical quality. We are aware that some geochemical data — in particular from older literature sources and using older analytical methods — may not meet current quality standards. Also, the accuracy and precision of geographic coordinates as given in publications may be compromised. We therefore urge all users of GEOROC to critically evaluate downloaded datasets and to be mindful of potential shortcomings with respect to geographic coordinates, analytical precision and accuracy and other metadata.
