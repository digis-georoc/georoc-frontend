      Use of GEOROC data compilations requires appropriate citation of all data sources. GEOROC datasets can only be distributed under the same license as the original.

    <h2 id="disclaimer" class="font-bold text-xl mt-8 mb-6 scroll-mt-20">Disclaimer</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">
      All data held within the GEOROC database have been harvested from peer-reviewed publications, comprising decades of international geochemical literature.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      The database is regularly supplemented with current publications. We take great effort to compile high-quality published data and to report all additional information on samples, analytical methods, reference materials and analytical uncertainties.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      Note that only the information recorded in the respective publications can be entered into the GEOROC database. In specific cases geographic coordinates may have been extracted from sample location maps as provided by the authors. Wherever needed, mineral and rock names that did not comply with rock and mineral names from BGS and, respectively, IMA vocabularies, were modified to meet these nomenclature standards. However, the original names given by authors in a publication are maintained in the dataset comment.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6">
      We cannot take responsibility for missing (meta-) data or analytical quality. We are aware that some geochemical data — in particular from older literature sources and using older analytical methods — may not meet current quality standards. Also, the accuracy and precision of geographic coordinates as given in publications may be compromised. We therefore urge all users of GEOROC to critically evaluate downloaded datasets and to be mindful of potential shortcomings with respect to geographic coordinates, analytical precision and accuracy and other metadata.

    <h2 id="how-to-filter" class="font-bold text-xl mt-8 mb-6 scroll-mt-20">How to Filter</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">We provide compositional filters for all analytes in the database in two ways:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-4 space-y-4">
        <li>
          For most-used data (major elements, a typical set of trace elements and isotope ratios), we offer a filter based on minimum and maximum values.
          Samples that do not have analytical values for a particular analyte will not be selected.
          Some elemental concentrations are reported in the original publications in different form, such as. FeO or Fe2O3, some even Fe3O4, or Fe atomic %) or when trace elements are given as ppm, µg/g, ppb or wt%. For these cases, we have recalculated all data to a single analytical unit in order to allow selecting corresponding minimum and maximum values for filters.
          However, when downloading selected data, the original analytical units or analytes are transferred as given in the original literature together with the recalculated values.
        </li>
        <li>
          All data can be selected according to “must have”, i.e. only data are selected by this filter for which compositional values are included in a sample’s analysis.
        </li>
      </ol>
